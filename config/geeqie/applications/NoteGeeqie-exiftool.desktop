# The name which appears in the menu:
Name=NoteGeeqie-exiftool
#Name[cs]=
#Name[fr]=
#Name[de]=Vorlage

# Replace "command" with the actual command or script:
# Exec=exiftool -rating=1 -overwrite_original  %f
# install: perl-image-exiftool
Exec=exiftool -if '$rating >= 1' "%f" && exiftool -rating=0 -overwrite_original "%f" || exiftool -rating=1 -overwrite_original "%f"
# Exec=mv "%f" ../valide_photos/



# %f	 A single file name, even if multiple files are selected. The
#        system reading the desktop entry should recognize that the program in
#        question cannot handle multiple file arguments, and it should should
#        probably spawn and execute multiple copies of a program for each
#        selected file if the program is not able to handle additional file
#        arguments. If files are not on the local file system (i.e. are on HTTP
#        or FTP locations), the files will be copied to the local file system
#        and %f will be expanded to point at the temporary file. Used for
#        programs that do not understand the URL syntax.
#
# %F	A list of files. Use for apps that can open several local files
#       at once. Each file is passed as a separate argument to the executable
#       program.
#
# %u	A single URL. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or
#       as file path.
#
# %U	A list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to
#       the executable program. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs
#       or as file path.
