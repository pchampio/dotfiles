# pi-plan-mode

Plan mode extension for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi): a toggleable read-only mode that blocks write/edit tools.

## Features

- **Simple toggle**: `/plan` enables/disables plan mode
- **Blocks write/edit tools**: When active, `write` and `edit` tools are completely blocked
- **Smart bash filtering**: Safe commands allowed, mutating commands reviewed by AI
- **Git command protection**: Mutating git commands (`commit`, `push`, `pull`, `merge`, etc.) are blocked
- **Status indicator**: Shows "⚠️ planning" in the UI when active
- **Session persistence**: Plan mode state survives session resume
- **Bash override memory**: Approved commands are remembered within a session

## Quick Start

1. Enable plan mode: `/plan`
2. Explore the codebase with read-only tools
3. Disable plan mode: `/plan` again

## Command Reference

| Command | What it does |

- Mutating git commands are blocked
- Commands can be approved manually and remembered for the session
